Nataliia Kulieshova — junior @ UC Berkeley (CS + Cognitive Science)
Focus: machine learning • computational neuroscience • brain–computer interfaces
```

My name is **Nataliia**. I am a junior at UC Berkeley, double-majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science (Go Bears! 🐻). I am passionate about machine learning, computational neuroscience, brain-computer interfaces, and all the other nerdy things. I am excited about using technology to make our world more inclusive to people with different cognitive and neurological abilities 🧠✨. In my free time, you'll find me either reading, swimming, running, baking, or writing for my STEM blog. Do you want to connect further? Shoot me an email!

## 🚀 My experiences so far:
```bash
> open nataliia.experiences
```
- **🚗 SWE Intern @ Uber (summer 2025):** Designed and implemented an Apache Lucene-based KNN query optimization in Uber’s search platform; projected to reduce CPU-related costs by up to 40% (~$5.6M annually). Cut p99.9 latency by 38% (130 ms → 80 ms) at ~350 QPS on a critical vector search use case by adding a configurable exact-search path in Lucene/HNSW to skip ANN attempt/fallback when filters are highly selective.
  
- **🚗 SWE Intern @ Uber (summer 2024):** Built authN/authZ for Uber’s Lucene-based search platform, adding role- and context-aware authorization with a custom, domain-driven policy model; secured sensitive index/query access for 50+ teams across Health, Eats, and Fulfillment.
  
- **🧠 MLE Intern @ Brightside Health:** Shipped a clinician-facing RAG web app in Python + LangChain on GCP that converts therapist-uploaded PDFs into a searchable, citation-linked knowledge graph; built an end-to-end NLP/IE pipeline (parsing, entity/relation extraction, normalization) with LLM guardrails, persisted in MongoDB, and delivered React + Cytoscape.js interactive graph UI with typed search APIs; validated on a hand-labeled eval set (86% accuracy, 81.8% precision).
  
- **🇺🇦 AI Intern @ Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine:** Conducted research on machine learning methodologies to analyze and interpret big data in the public sector, optimizing decision-making processes within the Ukrainian government

## 🔥 What I'm up to right now:
```bash
> open nataliia.currently
```
- **🏥 ML Researcher @ UCSF:** Developing an agentic AI system that integrates fMRI clinical data and LLMs for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis. (NeuroAI lab, advised by Dr. Pedro Pinheiro-Chagas). -- Think "Cursor" for clinicians. 
  
- **😴 ML Researcher @ Center for Human Sleep Science:** Modeling fMRI spectral signatures of sleep in healthy adults (Walker lab, advised by Dr. Omer Sharon). 
  
- **🌳 SWE @ Blueprint:** As a part of the [Blueprint club at Berkeley](https://calblueprint.org/), I am building [a web app](https://github.com/calblueprint/amigos-de-los-rios) to optimize and support volunteer tree-watering operations for [Amigos De Los Ríos non-profit](https://amigosdelosrios.org/).
  
- **🔥 SWE @ [BurntAI](https://github.com/BurntAI):** Building an AI-powered platform for immersive public speaking practice

If you made it this far, here’s a fun fact about rats:
Rats are ticklish and exhibit behaviors similar to human joy, emitting high-pitched ultrasonic "giggles" when tickled!! 🐀
