# Hey there 👀

My name is Nataliia. I'm a junior at **UC Berkeley**, double-majoring in **Computer Science** and **Cognitive Science**.
Most of my time is spent exploring the intersection of **machine learning**, **infrastructure**, and **computational neuroscience**, building systems that bridge code and cognition and help make our world more inclusive 🧠⚙️.

Previously, I’ve worked as a **Software Engineer intern at Uber** (x2), a **Machine Learning Fellow at Brightside Health**, and an **AI Intern at the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine**.

Currently working on:

* 🧠 **NeuroAI @ UCSF** — agentic AI for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis
* 😴 **Center for Human Sleep Science** — modeling fMRI spectral signatures of sleep
* 🌳 **Blueprint @ Berkeley** — building a volunteer management app for *Amigos De Los Ríos*
* 🪄 **EEG Sorting Hat** — a real-life Hogwarts hat that uses brain signals and eye tracking to sort you into houses
* 🔥 **BurntAI** — immersive public-speaking practice powered by LLMs

💗 I love brain-computer interfaces, elegant infra, and bad puns about neural nets.

💗 Outside of work, I run, swim, play a bunch of board games, bake, and write about neuroscience and AI for fun.
