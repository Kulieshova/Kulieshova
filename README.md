My name is **Nataliia**. I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley, double-majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science (Go Bears! 🐻). I am passionate about machine learning, computational neuroscience, brain-computer interfaces, and all the other nerdy things. I am excited about using technology to make our world more inclusive to people with different cognitive and neurological abilities 🧠✨. In my free time, you'll find me either reading, running, baking, or writing for my STEM blog. Do you want to connect further? Shoot me an email!
